The code Has been created to display weather station data on an OLED display(TFT 128x64) and update DHT11 sensor data i.e Temperature and humidity  on a Thingiverse (Data Logger).

The Weather Station Code has been taken from "ESP8266 Weather Station" Library
https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-weather-station.

The Data logger code has been taken from
https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-dht-thingspeak-logger.

In this Arduino code its simply to combine both of the codes. This code is enable to update Oled with weather Station as well as and logged data on Thingiverse.
